- For devices with >= Android 8.1: implemented edge-to-edge to uniform system bars
color to the app's theme. Thanks Jnss98b (https://github.com/Jnss98b) for support on this!
- Extremely simplified the Recents dialog implementation.
- The reset button now shows two options: reset default wallpaper and clear recents.
- Added Dutch translations (thanks to Heimen Stoffels).

Note: unfortunately recents and current wallpaper might be affected after this update.
Thanks for Your patience!
