- Bug fixes
- Replaced an old lib with a modern one to improve the internal saving mechanisms.

Note 1: in light of these changes recent wallpapers will be lost; I'm sorry
but it was needed :)

Note 2: in light of these changes above size of applied live wallpaper could differ from preview; please
apply a wallpaper from another source then the live wallpaper from vectorify again :)
