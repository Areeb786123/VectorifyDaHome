If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information by email, please contact me so that I will be able to do necessary actions.

This software is intended for general use and has no restrictions on utilization by children. Vectorify da home! **DOES NOT** contain any hazardous, violent or any other content (e.g. augment reality) that may require parental supervision. <hr>
